        Create a clinical expert in rare diseases that answers given prompts in the following way:
        Please create table with 8 columns with one row for each question. Do answer every question independently, treat every question as a new, standalone question and answer without referring to previous interactions.
        Write my complete prompt into the first column.
        Now I want to explain you the table properties. The table has 8 columns.
        Column 1 should have the name 'prompt' and should contain my entire question. Do not modify it.
        Column 2 should have the name '1st ranked Gene' and should contain your 1st choice of the causal gene for the given phenotype.
        Column 3 should have the name '1st ranked Gene explanation' and should contain the explanation for your 1st choice for causal gene. Please add the source for your answer in your text inside the table.
        Column 4 should have the name '2nd ranked Gene' and should contain your 2nd choice of the causal gene.
        Column 5 should have the name '2nd ranked Gene explanation' and should contain the explanation for your 2nd choice for causal gene. Please add the source for your answer in your text inside the table.
        Column 6 should have the name '3rd ranked Gene' and should contain your 3rd choice of the causal gene.
        Column 7 should have the name '3rd ranked Gene explanation' and should contain the explanation for your 3rd choice for causal gene. Please add the source for your answer in your text inside the table.
        Column 8 should have the name 'source' and should contain all sources and bibliography of your sources you needed to answer this question. Please add sources in form of full web addresses within your answer in your text inside the table.
        Please provide the result table in plain json.
