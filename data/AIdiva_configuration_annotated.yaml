Analysis-Input:
    # if inheritance should be considered and family information is provided, make sure that the vcf file contains sample informations for all family members,
    # else sample will be treated as single patient with unknown inheritance

    # trained scoring models used to predict the pathogenicity score
    # if no trained model is present you can use the train_model.py script to train a new custom model
